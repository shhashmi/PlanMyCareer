Clear, honest communication about AI differentiates products that build lasting user trust from those that generate backlash.`,

  'AI Tool & Ecosystem Literacy': `Product managers need to understand the AI tool landscape both for personal productivity and for making informed product decisions about AI integration. This fluency includes understanding the categories of AI capabilities available—foundation model APIs, embedded AI features in existing platforms, specialized AI services, and emerging agentic tools—and how to evaluate them for both personal use and product integration. You should understand enough about AI costs, latency, reliability, and capability limitations to have informed conversations with engineering about build-versus-buy decisions and feature feasibility. This also means staying current on AI product trends: understanding how competitor products are leveraging AI, what users are coming to expect from AI features, and where the capability frontier is moving. You don't need deep technical expertise, but you need efficient learning strategies—knowing which sources provide signal versus noise, how to quickly assess relevance to your product domain, and how to separate genuine innovation from marketing hype. This literacy enables you to make better product decisions and maintain credibility in AI-related discussions.`
